Some conclusions:

Charter Schools have higher reading and math scores than district schools.

Small and Medium sized schools have higher reading and math scores than large schools.

Schools with higher per student budgets actually have lower reading and math scores. They also tend to be larger schools.

Both reading and math scores appear to be relatively constant across grade levels for any given school. Differences between schools are much more pronounced than differences between grade levels within a school
